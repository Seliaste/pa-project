Doomlike running on OpenGL

IDEAS:

- Basic OpenGL engine
- Doomlike in first person view
- Using C++
- Must have file interaction (maybe best scores)
- Valgrind test objective: 0 leaks
- Maybe not custom renderer? Possible alternatives:
        - Horde3D
        - OGRE
- If time to do so, cyberpunk art
